\section{Inter-Domain Routing}
\subsection{Why Inter vs. Intra}
\begin{itemize}[nosep]
    \item Trust
    \item Policy
    \item Scale
    \item Performance
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Types of ASes}
\begin{itemize}[nosep]
    \item Local Traffic -- source or destination in local AS
    \item Transit Traffic -- passes through AS
    \item Stub AS
          \begin{itemize}[nosep]
              \item Connects to only a single other AS
          \end{itemize}
    \item Multihomed AS
          \begin{itemize}[nosep]
              \item Connects to multiple ASes
              \item Carries no transit traffic
          \end{itemize}
    \item Transit AS
          \begin{itemize}[nosep]
              \item Connects to multiple ASes and carries transit traffic
          \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\subsection{AS Relationships}
\begin{figure}[H]
    \tikzsetnextfilename{as-relationships}
    \begin{tikzpicture}[every node/.style={draw,circle,fill=gray!40,minimum size=1cm}]
        \node[minimum size=2cm] (a) {$A$};
        \node[left=of a] (z) {$Z$};
        \node[minimum size=2cm,above right=of a] (b) {$B$};
        \node[minimum size=2cm,below right=of b] (c) {$C$};
        \node[above right=of c] (x) {$X$};
        \node[right=of c] (y) {$Y$};

        \draw (z) -- (a) -- (c) -- (y);
        \draw (a) -- (b) -- (c) -- (x) -- (b);
    \end{tikzpicture}
\end{figure}
\begin{itemize}[nosep]
    \item How to prevent $X$ from forwarding transit between $B$ and $C$?
    \item How to avoid transmit between $CBA$?
          \begin{itemize}[nosep]
              \item $B: BAZ \to X$
              \item $B: BAZ \to C$? ($\implies Y:CBAZ$ and $Y:CAZ$)
          \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Autonomous System}
\begin{itemize}[nosep]
    \item Group of routers/prefixes typically under the control of a single operation
    \item Example: University of Houston
    \item Here is one list
          \begin{itemize}[nosep]
              \item \url{https://bgp.potaroo.net/cidr/autnums.html}
          \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\url{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autonomous_system_(Internet)}
\subsection{Path Vector Protocol}
\begin{itemize}[nosep]
    \item Distance vector algorithm with extra information
          \begin{itemize}[nosep]
              \item For each route, store the complete path (ASes)
              \item No extra computation, just extra storage (and traffic)
          \end{itemize}
    \item Advantages
          \begin{itemize}[nosep]
              \item Can make policy choices based on set of ASes
              \item Can easily avoid loops
          \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\begin{figure}[H]
    \tikzsetnextfilename{path-vector}
    \begin{tikzpicture}[every node/.style={circle,draw=blue,minimum size=2cm,fill=blue!40},node distance=2cm]
        \node (1) {\Huge\textcolor{white}{1}};
        \node[right=of 1] (2) {\Huge\textcolor{white}{2}};
        \node[right=of 2] (3) {\Huge\textcolor{white}{3}};
        \node[right=of 3] (4) {\Huge\textcolor{white}{4}};
        \draw[blue!40, thick] (1) -- (2);
        \draw[blue!40, thick] (2) -- (3) node[draw=none,fill=none,pos=0.5,above,black,minimum size=0] {1: 2, 1};
        \draw[blue!40, thick] (3) -- (4) node[draw=none,fill=none,pos=0.5,above,black,minimum size=0] {1: 3, 2, 1};
    \end{tikzpicture}
\end{figure}
\subsection{BGP = High Level}
\begin{itemize}[nosep]
    \item Abstract each AS to a single node
    \item Destinations are CIDR prefixes
    \item Exchange prefix \emph{reachability} with all neighbors
          \begin{itemize}[nosep]
              \item e.g. ``I can reach prefix 128.148.0.0/16 through ASes 44444 3356 14325 11078''
          \end{itemize}
    \item Select a single path by routing \emph{policy}
    \item Critical: learn many paths, propagate one
          \begin{itemize}[nosep]
              \item Add your ASN to advertised path
          \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Why study BGP?}
\begin{itemize}[nosep]
    \item Critical protocol: makes the Internet run
          \begin{itemize}[nosep]
              \item Only widely deployed EGP
          \end{itemize}
    \item Active area of problems!
          \begin{itemize}[nosep]
              \item Efficiency
              \item Cogent vs. Level3: Internet Partition
              \item Spammers use prefix hijacking
              \item Pakistan accidentally took down YouTube
              \item Egypt disconnected for 5 days
          \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\subsection{BGP Protocol Details}
\begin{itemize}[nosep]
    \item Separate roles of \emph{speakers} and \emph{gateways}
          \begin{itemize}[nosep]
              \item Speakers talk BGP with other AS
              \item Gateways are routers that border other AS
              \item Can have more gateways than speakers
              \item Speakers know how to reach gateways
          \end{itemize}
    \item Speakers connect over TCP on port 179
          \begin{itemize}[nosep]
              \item Bidirectional exchange over long-lived connection
          \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{BGP Implications}
\begin{itemize}[nosep]
    \item Explicit AS Path = Loop free
          \begin{itemize}[nosep]
              \item Except under churn, IGP/EGP mismatch
          \end{itemize}
    \item Reachability not guaranteed
          \begin{itemize}[nosep]
              \item Decentralized combination of policies
          \end{itemize}
    \item Not all ASes know all paths
    \item AS abstract $\to$ loss off efficiency
    \item scaling
          \begin{itemize}[nosep]
              \item 37 ASes
              \item 350K+ prefixes
              \item ASes with one prefix: 15664
              \item Most prefixes by one AS: 3686 (AS6389, BellSouth)
          \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{BGP and Policy}
\begin{itemize}[nosep]
    \item BGP provides capability for enforcing various policies
    \item Policies are not part of BGP: they are provided to BGP as configuration information
    \item BGP enforces policies by choosing paths from multiple alternatives and controlling advertisement to other ASes
\end{itemize}

\subsection{BGP Path Selection}
\begin{itemize}[nosep]
    \item Policies determined by path selection
    \item Information based on path attributes
    \item Attributes + external (policy) information
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Route Selection}
\begin{itemize}[nosep]
    \item \emph{More specific prefix?}
    \item Next-hop reachable?
    \item Prefer highest weight
          \begin{itemize}[nosep]
              \item Computed using some AS-specific local policy
          \end{itemize}
    \item Prefer highest local-pref
    \item Prefer locally originated routes
    \item Prefer routes with shortest AS path length
    \item Prefer eBGP over iBGP
    \item Prefer routes with lowest cost to egress point
          \begin{itemize}[nosep]
              \item Hot-potato routing
          \end{itemize}
    \item Tie-breaking rules
          \begin{itemize}[nosep]
              \item e.g. oldest route, lowest router-id
          \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Customer/Provider AS relationships}
\begin{itemize}[nosep]
    \item Customer pays for connectivity
          \begin{itemize}[nosep]
              \item e.g. University of Houston contracts with AboveNet and TW Telecom
              \item Customer is stub, provider is a transit
          \end{itemize}
    \item Many customers are multi-homed
          \begin{itemize}[nosep]
              \item e.g. AboveNet connects to Level3, Cogent,\dots
          \end{itemize}
    \item Typical policies:
          \begin{itemize}[nosep]
              \item Provider tells all neighbors how to reach customer
              \item Provider prefers routes from customers (\$\$)
              \item Customer does not provide transit service
          \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Peer Relationships}
\begin{itemize}[nosep]
    \item ASes agree to exchange traffic for free
          \begin{itemize}[nosep]
              \item Penalties/Renegotiate if imbalance
          \end{itemize}
    \item Tier 1 ISPs have no default route: all peer with each other
    \item You are Tier $i + 1$ if you have a default route to Tier $i$
    \item Typical policies
          \begin{itemize}[nosep]
              \item AS only exports customer routes to peer
              \item AS exports a peer's routes only to its customers
              \item Goal: avoid being transit when no gain
          \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Peering Drama}
\begin{itemize}[nosep]
    \item Cogent vs. Level3 were peers
    \item In 2003, Level3 decided to start charging Cogent
    \item Cogent said no
    \item \emph{Internet partition}: Cogent's customers couldn't get to Level3's customers and vice-versa
          \begin{itemize}[nosep]
              \item Other ISPs were affected as well
          \end{itemize}
    \item Took 3 weeks to reach an undisclosed agreement
\end{itemize}

\subsection{``Shutting Off'' the Internet}
\begin{itemize}[nosep]
    \item Starting from January 27, 2011, Egypt was disconnected from the Internet
          \begin{itemize}[nosep]
              \item 2769/2903 networks withdrawn from BGP (95\%!)
          \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
